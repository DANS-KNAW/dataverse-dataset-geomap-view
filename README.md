# dataverse-dataset-geomap-view

Adds a tab with a geographic map with the locations of found datasets in Dataverse. 
Currently this is only working for the DANS Archaeological Datastation, with its custom metadata block that contains location information and optional coordinates. 

The code is 'plain' Javascript with the use of jQuery and the Leaflet libraries. 

More information about using and developing on this code can be found here:
